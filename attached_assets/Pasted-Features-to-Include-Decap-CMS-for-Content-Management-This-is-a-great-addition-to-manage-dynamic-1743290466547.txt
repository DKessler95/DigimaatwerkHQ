Features to Include:
Decap CMS for Content Management

This is a great addition to manage dynamic content like case studies, blogs, and service updates efficiently. It will also allow for easy scalability as our offerings grow.

CookieYes Toolkit for GDPR Compliance

Absolutely essential for operating in the EU, especially in the Netherlands. Ensure it includes geo-targeted banners, multilingual support (Dutch + English), consent logging, and an auto-generated cookie policy.

Real-Time Chatbot Preview Functionality

This is a fantastic way to showcase our AI chatbot expertise. We can create an interactive demo where users can test chatbot features live on the website.

Multiple Communication Channels (Email, Phone, WhatsApp)

Offering multiple communication touchpoints will make it easier for potential clients to reach us and improve conversion rates.

Additional Recommendations:
To further enhance professionalism and drive conversions, I recommend adding the following:

FAQ Chatbot with Lead Capture

A chatbot specifically designed to answer FAQs about getting a website with Digimaatwerk and convincing customers to leave their details. It should include:

Lead qualification logic (name, email, project type).

Integration with Calendly or CRM for scheduling follow-ups.

AI-powered FAQ resolution for common questions.

Exit-intent triggers to capture abandoning users.

Interactive Portfolio

Use WebGL or Three.js to create an interactive portfolio that showcases our projects dynamically. This will demonstrate our technical expertise visually.

Client Testimonials and Reviews

Add Trustpilot or Google Reviews widgets alongside video testimonials from satisfied clients to build trust.

Smart CTAs and Conversion Tools

Implement context-aware call-to-action buttons that adapt based on user behavior (e.g., scroll depth).

Add a project cost calculator to help potential clients estimate pricing for their needs.

Performance Metrics Display

Include a real-time performance widget showcasing site speed and Core Web Vitals compliance as proof of our technical capabilities.

Security Badges and Compliance Proof

Display live SSL status, GDPR compliance badges, and any certifications (e.g., ISO) prominently on the site.

These features will not only make the website look professional but also position Digimaatwerk as a trustworthy, innovative, and customer-focused digital transformation partner.
