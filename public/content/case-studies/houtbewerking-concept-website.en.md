# Woodworking Concept Website

## Project Overview

For my little brother, who specializes in woodworking and is currently in training, I developed a concept website that showcases his craftsmanship skills and projects. The website combines a warm, natural appearance with modern functionality.

## Challenge

Creating a professional online presence for a starting woodworker who wants to showcase his skills and projects to potential clients, while preserving the traditional values of the craft.

## Solution

We developed a website featuring:
- **Warm, natural appearance** - Colors and typography that align with wood and nature
- **Portfolio section** - Clear presentation of his best work pieces
- **Modern functionality** - Responsive design and fast loading times
- **Personal touch** - Story behind the craft and the person

## Technology

- React for dynamic user interface
- Modern CSS for natural styling
- Responsive design for all devices
- Search engine optimized

## Result

A professional website that perfectly aligns with the artisanal sector and combines traditional values with modern web technology. This project demonstrates how we can deliver high-quality solutions even for smaller, personal projects.

### Our Approach

1. **Thorough analysis**: We began by analyzing their existing customer service data, common questions, and typical customer journeys.

2. **Tailored solution**: Rather than implementing a standard solution, we developed a chatbot specifically calibrated to the RetailTech product line and processes.

3. **Seamless integration**: The chatbot was integrated with their existing systems, giving it access to real-time product information, stock availability, and customer data.

4. **Training and refinement**: We trained the AI with historical conversations and continuous feedback from the customer service team to improve accuracy.

### Technological Solution

- **GPT-4 with RAG technology**: For enhanced context understanding and better responses
- **Multimodal processing**: Capable of handling both text and product images
- **Real-time integration**: Connected to inventory and order management systems
- **Multilingual support**: Dutch, English, German, and French

### Long-term Results

Six months after implementation, RetailTech has seen a significant ROI. The customer service team has been able to shift their focus to building deeper customer relationships rather than answering routine questions.

The chatbot continues to learn and improve, with monthly updates based on new products and changing customer needs.
