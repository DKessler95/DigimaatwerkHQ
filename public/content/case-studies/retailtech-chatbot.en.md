## Project Details

When RetailTech Netherlands approached us, they had a clear problem: their customer service team couldn't keep up with growing demand. With their rapidly expanding product line and customer base, they were receiving hundreds of similar questions that took up valuable time.

### Our Approach

1. **Thorough analysis**: We began by analyzing their existing customer service data, common questions, and typical customer journeys.

2. **Tailored solution**: Rather than implementing a standard solution, we developed a chatbot specifically calibrated to the RetailTech product line and processes.

3. **Seamless integration**: The chatbot was integrated with their existing systems, giving it access to real-time product information, stock availability, and customer data.

4. **Training and refinement**: We trained the AI with historical conversations and continuous feedback from the customer service team to improve accuracy.

### Technological Solution

- **GPT-4 with RAG technology**: For enhanced context understanding and better responses
- **Multimodal processing**: Capable of handling both text and product images
- **Real-time integration**: Connected to inventory and order management systems
- **Multilingual support**: Dutch, English, German, and French

### Long-term Results

Six months after implementation, RetailTech has seen a significant ROI. The customer service team has been able to shift their focus to building deeper customer relationships rather than answering routine questions.

The chatbot continues to learn and improve, with monthly updates based on new products and changing customer needs.
