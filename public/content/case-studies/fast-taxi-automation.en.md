# Email Process Automation for Fast Taxi Rotterdam

## Project Overview

Fast Taxi Rotterdam, a leading taxi company in the Rotterdam region, faced a challenge: managing a growing number of email requests from customers. These requests ranged from ride bookings to questions about rates and availability. Manually processing these emails led to delays, errors, and increased workload for the team. Digimaatwerk was brought in to automate this process and improve efficiency.

## The Challenge

Fast Taxi Rotterdam received dozens of emails daily with booking requests and customer inquiries. The process was entirely manual, resulting in:
- **Longer response times:** Customers sometimes had to wait hours for a response.
- **Human errors:** Forgotten bookings or incorrect data entry.
- **High workload:** The team spent a lot of time on routine tasks instead of focusing on strategic improvements.

The goal was to develop an automated system that:
1. Categorizes and prioritizes emails.
2. Automatically generates responses to frequently asked questions.
3. Processes booking requests and synchronizes with the schedule.

## Our Approach

Digimaatwerk implemented a custom workflow automation solution using modern tools such as **Zapier**, **Google Workspace**, and **Twilio**. The system included the following features:

### 1. **Email Categorization**
- Using an AI-based filter, incoming emails were automatically categorized based on content (e.g., ride bookings, general questions, complaints).
- Priorities were set to handle urgent requests more quickly.

### 2. **Automatic Responses**
- A database of frequently asked questions was integrated into the system to automatically generate responses to standard questions like rates, availability, and payment methods.
- Customers received a professional response within seconds.

### 3. **Booking Processing**
- Booking requests were automatically processed and added to a shared Google Calendar.
- Confirmation emails with ride details were sent directly to customers.

### 4. **Notification System**
- SMS reminders were sent to customers and drivers via Twilio to confirm scheduled rides.

## The Technical Solution

The technical implementation consisted of:

- **Zapier:** For connecting email systems with Google Calendar and Twilio.
- **Google Workspace:** For shared calendars and document management.
- **Twilio API:** For sending SMS reminders.
- **AI-based filters:** For automatic email categorization.

The system works as follows:

1. A customer sends an email to Fast Taxi Rotterdam (e.g., "I want to book a taxi for tomorrow at 10:00 AM").
2. The system analyzes the content of the email:
   - Categorizes it as a "Booking Request."
   - Checks availability via the shared Google Calendar.
3. An automatic confirmation email is sent to the customer with details about the ride.
4. The booking is added to the schedule, including an SMS reminder for both the customer and the driver.

## Results

The implementation of the automated email process delivered the following benefits:

- **Faster response times:** Responses to customer inquiries were reduced from hours to seconds.
- **Efficiency improvement:** The team saved more than 20 hours per week on manual processing.
- **Higher customer satisfaction:** Customers appreciated the quick responses and clear communication.
- **Fewer errors:** Automation eliminated virtually all human errors in booking processing.
- **Improved work atmosphere:** Employees could focus on customer-oriented activities rather than administration.
