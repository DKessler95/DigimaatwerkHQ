# 3D Product Configurator

## Project Overview

DesignMeubel, a Dutch furniture retailer with a growing online presence, faced two challenges: low conversion rates on their website and a high number of returns. Customers had difficulty imagining how furniture would look in their homes, leading to hesitation in purchasing and disappointment after receipt.

## The Challenge

- Customers couldn't properly visualize products before purchase
- Static product photos didn't show all aspects and customization options
- High return rate of 28% on online purchases
- Low online conversion of 1.7%
- Need to showcase all material options and configurations

## Our Approach

We developed an advanced 3D product configurator that:

1. **Real-time visualization** of all products
2. **Interactive customization** of materials, colors, and options
3. **360-degree rotation** support for complete product inspection
4. **Augmented Reality** integration to place products in their own space
5. **Seamless integration** with the existing e-commerce platform

## The Technical Solution

The configurator is built with advanced web technologies:

- **Three.js** for high-quality 3D rendering in the browser
- **WebGL** for hardware acceleration and smooth performance
- **React** for a responsive user interface
- **Optimized 3D models** for fast loading times
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for optimal mobile experience
- **WebAR** for AR functionality without app installation

## Results

The implementation resulted in significant improvements:

- **Conversion rate increased** from 1.7% to 2.25% (32% increase)
- **Return rate decreased** from 28% to 15% (47% reduction)
- **Average order value increased** by 24%
- **Time spent on site doubled**
- **78% of visitors** interact with the configurator
- **Social sharing** of custom designs generated new traffic

## Customer Feedback

> "The 3D configurator has transformed our online sales strategy. Customers are now much more confident in their purchases, resulting in fewer returns and higher customer satisfaction. It's a real game-changer for our business." - Lisa Bos, E-commerce Manager at DesignMeubel

An unexpected benefit was that in-store sales staff also started using the configurator as a sales tool, improving the omnichannel experience and leading to a 15% increase in in-store conversions.
