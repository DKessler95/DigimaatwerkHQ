A personal project where I developed a concept website for my little brother who specializes in woodworking and is currently in training. The website showcases his craftsmanship skills and projects with a warm, natural appearance that fits the woodworking profession.

The design emphasizes the quality of handwork and craftsmanship, with a portfolio section that displays his best work pieces. The website is built with modern web technology but maintains a traditional, trustworthy appearance that suits the artisanal sector.

This project demonstrates how we can also develop professional websites for smaller, personal projects that perfectly align with the target audience and field of work.
