  For the new Fast Taxi Rotterdam website, Digimaatwerk developed a modern, user-friendly, and fully optimized solution that offers a significant improvement over the old website. The new site is faster, mobile-friendly, and features an intuitive interface that allows customers to easily book rides.

  A key innovation is the automatic workflow integration with WhatsApp Business. Orders received through the website are forwarded directly to WhatsApp, allowing drivers to respond faster and plan rides more efficiently. This not only reduces response time but also increases customer satisfaction and the number of completed bookings.

  Thanks to these improvements, Fast Taxi Rotterdam can provide smoother service, serve more customers, and ultimately generate more profit. This case illustrates how smart technology and a well-designed website contribute to business optimization and growth.
