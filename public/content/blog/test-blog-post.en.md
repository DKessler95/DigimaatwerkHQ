# Working with the CMS: A Guide

## Introduction

Content Management Systems (CMS) are essential for modern websites. They allow non-technical users to add and edit content without knowledge of HTML or programming. In this blog post, we'll show you how to use our CMS to create blog posts and case studies.

## Markdown Basics

Our CMS uses Markdown, a simple markup language that's easy to learn. Here are some basic principles:

### Headings

You can create headings with hashes (#):

```
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
```

### Text Formatting

**Bold text** is created with two asterisks: `**bold**`
*Italic text* is created with one asterisk: `*italic*`

### Lists

Unordered lists are created with dashes:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

Numbered lists are created with numbers:

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

### Hyperlinks

[Link text](https://www.example.com) is created like this: `[Link text](https://www.example.com)`
